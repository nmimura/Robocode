# Robocode
This bot has been created by Michael Nguyen and Nana Mimura for CS141 at Cal Poly Pomona, instructed by Dr. Husain.

Functions of the ManaBot:
- scanning energy levels of other bots- if another bot's energy level goes down, then the bot must've just shot a bullet; therefore, the    ManaBot will move to dodge the shot
- shooting different strength bullets depending on how close/far away the other bot is
- avoiding collisions with walls
